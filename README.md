Adatpive Chirplet Transform using Matching Pursuit Algorithm (MP-ACT)

**MPACT** is an open-source MatLab(R) toolbox that implements multi-component chirplet signal analysis using matching pursuit algorithm.

**MPACT** is protected by the GPL v3 Open Source License.

The code repository for **MPACT** is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/jiecui/mpact.

Installation
------------
1. Copy the files to the directory of your choice, e.g. ~/mpact/
1. Within Matlab, go the directory where you have copied the files
   e.g. >> cd(‘~/mpact/’);
1. Add the directory and its subdirectories into MatLab search path.
1. Type MatLab command, i.e. >> doc, to bring up MatLab help browser.
1. Find “Adaptive Chirplet Transform with Matching Pursuit Toolbox” in
   the section of Supplemental Software.
1. Follow the instructions on the screen.
